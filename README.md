# micropy-ENC28J60
ENC28J60 Ethernet chip driver for MicroPython v1.17 (RP2)

## Rationale
ENC28J60 is a popular and cheap module for DIY projects.
At the moment, however, there is no driver for the MicroPython environment.
The Python implementation seems easy for further improvements and self adaptation.

## Installation
Copy enc28j60.py to your board into /enc28j60 directory.
